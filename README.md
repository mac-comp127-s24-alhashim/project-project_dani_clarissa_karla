Overall Description:

  The Mascot Generator game is designed to allow users to create a mascot based off the Macalester building and area of study they have the most interest in. The user may choose one of the four buildings, OLRI, Carnegie, Old Main, and JWall, in order to produce a specific background that relates to the majors that take place in said building. Afterwards the user will be given a blank canvas of a mascot to customize to their liking, while the main body will remain the same, an egg shape, the user will be able to pick it's ears, eyes, feet, accessories, etc. Once the user is satisfied with their mascot they'll press submit and have a brand new mascot for the building/departments of their choice.

Context:
-
  Macalester College is a private institution that was founded in 1874. Macalester students come from every state in the U.S. and 94 countries to attend academic programs ranked among the top in the nation. The college's philosophy of global citizenship and collaborative learning prepares students with diverse backgrounds. It is due to its varied range of experiences in the student body, that Macalester focuses on having an accessible curriculum that allows students to explore different areas of study. THe most popular majors at Macalester College include Multi/Interdisciplinary Studies, Visual and Performing Arts, Physical Sciences, Psychology, Mathematics, and Economics. As a very accepting, open-minded, and active college, it offers many opportunities to engage with the Twin Cities community, study abroad, and learn about different cultures. 

Inspiration/Mission:
-
The combined experience of dress up games as kids, the fun and creativity that was afforded to us as children by being able to design such characters. As Macalester students, creating an interactive user-friendly game that allows users to bring their past experiences with these types of games together with their experience as they transition into college was very important.
