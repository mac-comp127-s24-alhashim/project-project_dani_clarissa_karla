Description Of Our Project:
-
  Our project consists of having the user choose one of the four buildings, OLRI, Carnegie, Old Main, and JWall, in order to produce a specific background that relates to the majors that take place in said building. Afterwards the user will be given a blank canvas of a mascot to customize to their liking, while the main body will remain the same, an egg shape, the user will be able to pick it's ears, eyes, feet, accessories, etc. Once the user is satisfied with their mascot they'll press submit and have a brand new mascot for the building/departments of their choice.

Our reason for choosing this project:
-
  We chose this project as we thought it would be a fun and cute project to make, especially one that directly relates to macalester, in this case it's departments/buildings. 

Inspiration:
-
The combined experience of dress up games as kids, the fun and creativity that was afforded to us as children by being able to design such characters.
